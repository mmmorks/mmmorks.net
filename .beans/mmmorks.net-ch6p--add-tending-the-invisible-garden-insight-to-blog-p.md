Incorporate Yegge's 'Tending the Invisible Garden' section - the explicit admission that 'you don't usually have time to inspect the code you're creating.' You do regular sweeps (code review → bug fix → code review) hoping most of the time you don't find anything bad. Directly validates the 'you can't see the factory' point.
