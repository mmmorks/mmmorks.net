Add the real-world Ajit/Ryan example: two ex-Amazon devs using coding agents go so fast teammates can't keep up. Quote: '2 hours ago\!? That's ancient\!' They developed rules like 'everything you do has to be 100% transparent and announced, all the time.' Validates the throughput-over-correctness point.
