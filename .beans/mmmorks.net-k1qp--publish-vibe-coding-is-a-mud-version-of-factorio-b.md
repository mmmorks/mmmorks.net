- Introduction positioning vibe coding as MUD-meets-Factorio
- The MUD Layer: command-based interaction with persistent world

- Synthesis: characteristics of the MUD-Factorio genre
- Skill Transfer Question: who will excel at this?
- Dark Pattern: addiction loops
- Implications for tool builders, developers, and organizations
