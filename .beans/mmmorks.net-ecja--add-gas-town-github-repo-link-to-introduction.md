Weave the Gas Town GitHub repository link (https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown) into the blog post introduction.

Currently the intro mentions Steve Yegge's Gas Town with a link to the Medium post announcing it. We should also include a reference to the actual GitHub repo so readers can explore the code and implementation.

Consider where it fits best - either alongside the Medium post link or as a separate mention when first describing the tool's capabilities.
