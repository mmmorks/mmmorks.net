Review 'The Future of Coding Agents' follow-up post (sources/the-future-of-coding-agents.pdf) to identify any key insights that would strengthen the MUD-Factorio narrative.

Focus on:
- Broader industry trends that validate the paradigm shift argument
- Predictions or observations about who will excel at this style of work
- Evolution of Gas Town that shows the MUD-Factorio pattern solidifying
- Any meta-commentary on why this interaction model works

Only extract highly relevant points that add to our core argument. Don't bloat the article with tangential information.
