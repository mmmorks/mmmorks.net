Review 'The Future of Coding Agents' follow-up post (sources/the-future-of-coding-agents.pdf) to identify any key insights that would strengthen the MUD-Factorio narrative.

Focus on:
- Broader industry trends that validate the paradigm shift argument
- Predictions or observations about who will excel at this style of work
- Evolution of Gas Town that shows the MUD-Factorio pattern solidifying
- Any meta-commentary on why this interaction model works

Only extract highly relevant points that add to our core argument. Don't bloat the article with tangential information.

## Review Findings

### Strongest additions (directly validate the factory metaphor):

1. **"Workers vs Factory" framing** - Yegge explicitly says: "coding agent shops are going to wake up, realize that they have built workers when I've built a factory." This is direct validation of our Factorio framing using his own language. Could strengthen the SimCity/Factorio section.

2. **"Nature prefers colonies" quote** (from Brendan Hopper): "when work needs to be done, nature prefers colonies. Nature builds ant colonies, while Claude Code is 'the world's biggest fuckin' ant.'" Reinforces swarm/factory paradigm over super-worker.

### Real-world evidence for throughput thinking:

3. **The Ajit/Ryan case study** - Two ex-Amazon devs using coding agents go so fast that teammates can't keep up. Quote: "2 hours ago!? That's ancient!" They've developed new rules like "everything you do has to be 100% transparent and announced, all the time." This is the throughput paradigm applied to human teams - validates our "flow over correctness" point.

4. **"One engineer per repo" anti-pattern** - Gene Kim and Yegge report a company adopted this because merge conflicts were overwhelming them. They "basically gave up and punted on coordination, ceding the floor to raw single-dev velocity." Shows factory model creates scaling challenges traditional dev can't handle.

### Who will excel:

5. **"Evolution of Coders" levels (1-8)** - Yegge describes a skill progression from "no AI trust" to "factory farming." Level 7+ users report Gas Town is "fun" - connects to our addiction/game mechanics section. Could enhance the "Skill Transfer Question" section.

### Meta-commentary on the paradigm:

6. **"We've been vibe coding since the Stone Age"** - "Programming has always been a best-effort, we'll-fix-shit-later endeavor. We always ship with bugs. The question is, how close is it? How good are your tests?" This reframes vibe coding not as new, but as making explicit what was always implicit.

### Recommendation

The strongest additions would be:
- The "workers vs factory" and "nature prefers colonies" quotes for the Factorio section
- The Ajit/Ryan anecdote for the throughput section
- Optionally the "vibe coding since Stone Age" point as a philosophical aside
