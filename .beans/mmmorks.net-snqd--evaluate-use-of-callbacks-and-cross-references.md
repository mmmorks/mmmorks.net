Review the article to ensure sufficient callbacks to concepts introduced early on, particularly:
- The Paxos reference (mentioned in intro as a cautionary tale)
- MUD concepts introduced in the first section
- Factorio/SimCity concepts

Ensure these threads are woven through the article effectively and that the narrative payoff justifies the setup.
