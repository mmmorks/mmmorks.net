Assess whether including SimCity alongside Factorio strengthens or muddies the analogy:
- SimCity and Factorio are different games with different mechanics
- Are we conflating them when we should pick one?
- Does SimCity add a distinct insight, or is it just adding confusion?
- Should we commit to Factorio as the primary analogy, or is there value in the SimCity comparison?
- Consider: SimCity = emergent/organic zoning, Factorio = direct factory construction

Make a recommendation: strengthen SimCity's unique contribution, or cut it in favor of a cleaner Factorio focus.
