Review the overall structure and flow of the article:
- Does each section transition naturally?
- Are examples well-integrated or do they feel forced?
- Is the progression from MUD → Factorio → Synthesis → Implications clear?
- Are there any tangents that should be trimmed or expanded?
- Does the ending land effectively?
