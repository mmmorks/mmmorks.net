Draw a parallel between the Gas Town emergency user manual and Leslie Lamport's 'The Part-Time Parliament' paper that introduced the Paxos algorithm.

The comparison: Lamport's paper was so wrapped in an obtuse fictional narrative about a fictional Greek parliament that it took two decades before people understood and started using the Paxos algorithm it introduced. This parallels how the Gas Town manifesto's playful, MUD-like presentation might obscure (or enhance?) the coding insights within.

This could be a humorous self-aware nod to the risks and rewards of creative technical writing.
