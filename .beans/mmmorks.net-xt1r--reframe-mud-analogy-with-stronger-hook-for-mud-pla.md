Reframe the MUD analogy section with a more engaging hook that appeals to both MUD players and especially those who built/ran MUDs.

Suggested hook: "If you ever played a MUD—or better yet, if you ever ran one—Gas Town will feel familiar."

This reframing:
- Creates immediate connection with the target audience who will 'get it'
- Elevates the analogy by appealing to MUD builders/admins (the 'wizards' mentioned later)
- Sets up the structural comparison more compellingly
- Makes the insight feel like an 'aha' moment for the initiated

Consider whether this hook works better at the very start of the MUD Layer section, or if it should be woven into the opening paragraphs of the article itself.
