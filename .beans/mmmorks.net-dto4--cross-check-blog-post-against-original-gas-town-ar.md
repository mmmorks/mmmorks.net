Review the blog post alongside Steve Yegge's original Gas Town article (markdown available in sources directory) to ensure:

- Accurate representation of Gas Town's features and concepts
- Correct terminology (polecats, refineries, witnesses, molecules, convoys, etc.)
- No mischaracterization of how the system works
- Proper attribution of Yegge's quotes and ideas
- Verify technical details like the tmux UI, Beads database, merge queue behavior

This is a fact-checking pass to make sure the MUD-Factorio analogy is built on solid ground and doesn't misrepresent the actual Gas Town implementation.
