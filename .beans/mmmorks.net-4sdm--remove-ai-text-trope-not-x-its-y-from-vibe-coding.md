Fix 4 instances of the 'not X, it's Y' AI text trope pattern in the vibe coding article:

1. Line 49: The metaphor isn't about... it's about...
2. Line 83: Vibe coding isn't introducing... it's making explicit...
3. Line 125: That's not a traditional engineering skill. It's a competitive gaming skill.
4. Line 127: Not a gradual evolution... but a genuine discontinuity...
