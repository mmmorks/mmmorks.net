Review the 'Gas Town Emergency User Manual' follow-up post (sources/Gas Town Emergency User Manual... .pdf) to identify any key insights that would strengthen the MUD-Factorio narrative.

Focus on:
- New terminology or concepts that reinforce the MUD-Factorio analogy
- Real-world usage patterns that validate the throughput/simulation thinking
- Admission of failure modes that support the 'addiction loop' or 'factory running you' points
- Any revelations about how users actually interact with the system

Only extract highly relevant points that add to our core argument. Don't bloat the article with tangential information.
