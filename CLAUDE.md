# Writing Style Guide for mmmorks.net

This document captures the stylistic conventions and editorial standards for content on this blog, extracted from editorial review beans and established patterns.

## Spelling and Grammar

**Use Oxford English Spelling:**
- British spelling (colour, behaviour, favour, etc.)
- BUT: Use `-ize/-yze` suffixes instead of `-ise/-yse` (realize, analyze, organize, etc.)
- Examples: "realise" → "realize" ✓, "behavior" → "behaviour" ✓

## Voice and Tone

### Be Human, Not Corporate

- **Avoid AI text tropes** that make writing feel generated:
  - ❌ "Here's where it gets interesting"
  - ❌ "Here's the thing:"
  - ❌ "Let me be clear"
  - ❌ "The real question is..."
  - ❌ "What This Means" (as a heading)
  - ❌ Excessive "And" or "But" sentence starters
  - ❌ "X isn't just Y—it's Z" (unless genuinely serving the argument)

- **Avoid business clichés:**
  - Game-changer, paradigm shift, synergy, low-hanging fruit, think outside the box
  - "At the end of the day", "moving forward", "best of both worlds"

- **Embrace specificity:**
  - Use concrete examples and specific technical details
  - Reference actual games, tools, frameworks by name
  - Include relevant in-jokes and community references where appropriate
  - Don't shy away from technical depth

### Personality is Good

- **Informal language is welcome:**
  - "mad-scientist documentation" ✓
  - Strategic profanity when it adds emphasis (not gratuitously)
  - Personal observations ("I kept circling back to...", "I think we're seeing...")

- **Be opinionated:**
  - Take clear positions
  - Make predictions and arguments
  - It's OK to be uncertain, but own your perspective
  - Self-awareness about the writing itself is good (meta-commentary)

- **Use parentheticals and asides:**
  - They add conversational texture
  - Good for qualifying statements or adding context
  - Don't overdo it, but they're useful

## Structure and Flow

### Narrative Coherence

- **Use callbacks and cross-references:**
  - Introduce concepts early, reference them later
  - Echo key phrases with new context
  - Don't just repeat—add meaning when you return to an idea
  - Example: "The factory must grow" works because it means something different at the end

- **Close narrative loops:**
  - If you raise a question in the intro, answer it in the conclusion
  - Don't leave provocative frameworks hanging (e.g., the Paxos comparison)
  - Tie together threads from different sections

- **Smooth transitions:**
  - Avoid "Here's where..." constructions
  - Connect sections conceptually, not just structurally
  - The relationship between sections should be clear

### Pacing and Balance

- **Don't front-load all the depth:**
  - Keep development consistent throughout
  - Later sections deserve attention too
  - The second half shouldn't feel rushed

- **Mix taxonomy with narrative:**
  - Enumerated lists are fine when defining or categorizing
  - But weave them into the flow—don't just dump bullets
  - Provide context for why you're listing things

- **Vary sentence structure:**
  - Short sentences for emphasis
  - Longer sentences for development and nuance
  - Avoid monotonous rhythm

## Content Quality

### Evidence and Claims

- **Support strong claims with evidence:**
  - Don't say "evidence is emerging" based on one anecdote
  - Qualify speculative points ("might be", "could indicate")
  - Be honest about thin evidence
  - Multiple examples are better than one

- **Qualify generalizations:**
  - "Most commercial software development" not "programming"
  - Acknowledge exceptions (formal methods, safety-critical systems)
  - Don't overstate for rhetorical effect

- **Fact-check technical details:**
  - Verify quotes and attributions
  - Check terminology against source materials
  - Ensure technical claims are accurate
  - Don't misrepresent how tools or systems work

### References and Attribution

- **Cite sources properly:**
  - Link to original articles, papers, GitHub repos
  - Quote directly when using someone's words
  - Provide context for who people are (don't assume readers know)
  - Example: "Brendan Hopper observed" → who is this person and why should we care?

- **Give credit:**
  - Co-authored commits for agent work
  - Acknowledge where ideas come from
  - Don't present others' insights as your own discoveries

## Common Patterns to Avoid

### AI Fingerprints

From the "Identify clichés and AI text tropes" review bean, watch for:

1. **"Here's" constructions:**
   - "Here's where it gets interesting" → just start with the interesting part
   - "Here's the thing" → cut it entirely
   - "And here's the crucial part" → consider "The crucial part:" or rephrase

2. **Hedging overuse:**
   - Some hedging is intellectually honest
   - But don't hedge everything
   - "I think", "it seems", "might be" in every sentence weakens writing

3. **Formulaic structures:**
   - "On the one hand... on the other hand" → only when genuinely weighing alternatives
   - "The real question is..." → usually unnecessary
   - Overly balanced takes that refuse to commit

4. **Empty intensifiers:**
   - "Crucially", "importantly", "fundamentally" → use sparingly
   - They're often filler when the point should be self-evident

### Structural Anti-patterns

- **List-heavy sections without narrative glue:**
  - Pure enumeration feels generated
  - Provide context and connections between items
  - Explain why these particular points matter

- **Restating without adding:**
  - Every section should advance the argument
  - Summaries should add insight, not just recap
  - If you're saying the same thing in different words, cut it

- **Missing transitions:**
  - Abrupt jumps between topics feel jarring
  - Provide conceptual bridges
  - "If X, then Y" structures work well

## Genre-Specific Notes

### Technical Writing

- **Balance accessibility and depth:**
  - Define niche terms for broader audiences (MUD, Factorio mechanics)
  - But don't dumb down—assume intelligent readers
  - 1-2 sentence explanations are usually enough

- **Show, don't just tell:**
  - Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
  - Walk through actual code or commands when relevant
  - Let readers see the thing you're describing

### Blog Posts vs Articles

- **Blog posts can be more casual:**
  - Personal anecdotes are appropriate
  - You can be more speculative
  - First-person perspective is natural

- **But maintain quality:**
  - Casual doesn't mean sloppy
  - Still fact-check and cite sources
  - Structure still matters

## Checklist for Agent Reviewing Content

Before marking editorial work complete, verify:

- [ ] No AI text tropes ("Here's where...", "The thing is...", etc.)
- [ ] No business clichés or buzzwords
- [ ] All callbacks and cross-references work
- [ ] No narrative loops left open
- [ ] Transitions between sections are smooth
- [ ] Strong claims are supported with evidence
- [ ] Generalizations are qualified appropriately
- [ ] All quotes are accurate and attributed
- [ ] Technical details are fact-checked
- [ ] Oxford English Spelling is used consistently
- [ ] Pacing is balanced throughout (not front-loaded)
- [ ] Sentence structure varies naturally
- [ ] The conclusion ties threads together effectively

## Examples from Completed Work

### Good Callbacks

From the vibe coding article:

- **"The factory must grow"** - First mentioned in context of throughput thinking, returns as final line with new meaning about control and agency
- **"Slot machines"** - Yegge quote about checking results, returns in addiction section
- **"Slop fish into barrels"** - Introduces throughput mentality, returns when discussing skill transfer

### Good Specificity

- Naming actual games: Blood on the Clocktower, Dwarf Fortress, Factorio
- Specific Gas Town terminology: polecats, refineries, witnesses, molecules, convoys
- Concrete quotes with attribution rather than paraphrasing

### Good Voice

- "mad-scientist documentation" (informal but vivid)
- "biggest fuckin' ant" (keeps the original quote's profanity because it adds emphasis)
- "(We'll see.)" (parenthetical aside acknowledging uncertainty)

### Improved from Edits

**Before:** "Here's where it gets interesting. In SimCity..."
**After:** "In SimCity..." (just start with the content)

**Before:** "Here's the thing, though: programming has always been..."
**After:** "Programming has always been..." (cut the filler)

**Before:** "programming has *always* been a best-effort, we'll-fix-shit-later endeavor" (overgeneralization)
**After:** "most commercial software development has *always* been..." (qualified)

## When in Doubt

1. **Cut the filler.** If a phrase doesn't add meaning, remove it.
2. **Be specific.** Generic descriptions are weak. Name things.
3. **Show your work.** Evidence > assertion.
4. **Read it aloud.** Does it sound like a human wrote it?
5. **Follow the beans.** Previous editorial reviews contain good guidance.
